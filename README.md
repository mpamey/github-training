# Github-training


## First time dev setup in Pycharm
1. Create a virtual environment by using the following commands: `conda create -n myenv python=3.10`.
2. Subsequently, activate your environment using: `conda activate myenv`.
3. Install the packages defined in the requirements.txt file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Check whether you have all the required installations: `pip list`. This should show a list of installed packages.

## Assignment
- Make new functions `distract`, `divide`, and `multiply` for the `mymath` module, and push your changes.
- For each function, ensure you add your changes in a separate branch that is diverged from the `main` branch.
- When you have finished your task, submit a pull request (PR). Ask others for a review via the Github interface.

## Tips
- Before you add stuff, makes sure you have pulled all remote changes.
- Branching! Try to make your changes on separate branches, and merge them separately to the `main` branch.
